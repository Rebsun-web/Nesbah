# Bank Portal Structure Fix

## 🔍 **Issue Identified:**

The **BoughtLeadsDisplay** component (which shows purchased leads) was incorrectly placed on the main **Dashboard** page instead of the **History** tab for bank users.

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### 1. **Removed from Dashboard** (`src/app/bankPortal/page.jsx`)
- ❌ Removed `BoughtLeadsDisplay` component from main dashboard
- ❌ Removed import statement
- ✅ Dashboard now shows only:
  - Welcome stats (new leads, purchased leads, ignored leads, total revenue)
  - Incoming applications table

### 2. **Added to History Tab** (`src/app/bankPortal/bankHistory/page.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `BoughtLeadsDisplay` component to History page
- ✅ Added userInfo state management
- ✅ Added import statement
- ✅ History tab now shows:
  - Purchased leads table (LeadsHistoryTable)
  - Purchased leads display (BoughtLeadsDisplay)

## 🎯 **Correct Structure Now:**

### **Dashboard Tab** (`/bankPortal`)
- Welcome stats (metrics)
- Incoming applications (available leads to purchase)

### **History Tab** (`/bankPortal/bankHistory`)
- Purchased leads history
- Detailed purchased leads display with offers

## 🚀 **User Experience:**

1. **Bank users** can now:
   - View incoming applications on the **Dashboard**
   - View their purchased leads and offers in the **History** tab
   - Navigate between tabs using the navbar

2. **Clean separation** of concerns:
   - Dashboard = Active/current applications
   - History = Past purchases and completed deals

## 📋 **Navigation Structure:**

```
Bank Portal
├── Dashboard (/bankPortal)
│   ├── Welcome stats
│   └── Incoming applications
└── History (/bankPortal/bankHistory)
    ├── Purchased leads table
    └── Purchased leads display
```

The bank portal now has the correct structure with purchased leads properly organized in the History tab!
