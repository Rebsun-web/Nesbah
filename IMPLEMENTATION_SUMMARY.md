# 48-Hour Auction System Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

### 1. Database Changes

#### New `approved_leads` Table
- **Purpose**: Track all leads purchased by banks
- **Key Fields**:
  - `application_id` - Reference to the application
  - `bank_user_id` - Reference to the bank that purchased
  - `purchased_at` - Timestamp of purchase
  - `offer_device_setup_fee` - Bank's setup fee offer
  - `offer_transaction_fee_mada` - Mada transaction fee
  - `offer_transaction_fee_visa_mc` - Visa/Mastercard transaction fee
  - `offer_settlement_time_mada` - Settlement time for Mada
  - `offer_comment` - Additional notes from bank
  - `status` - Lead status (active, completed, cancelled)
- **Constraints**: Unique constraint on (application_id, bank_user_id)

#### Updated Status Constraints
- **submitted_applications**: Only allows `live_auction`, `approved_leads`, `complete`, `ignored`
- **pos_application**: Only allows `live_auction`, `approved_leads`, `complete`, `ignored`

#### Performance Indexes
- `idx_submitted_applications_status_auction_end` - For efficient auction queries
- `idx_approved_leads_application_bank` - For approved leads lookups
- `idx_approved_leads_purchased_at` - For purchase date queries

### 2. Application Submission Changes

#### Updated `src/app/api/posApplication/route.jsx`
- **New Status**: Applications now start with `live_auction` status
- **Auction End Time**: Set to 48 hours from submission
- **Consistent Updates**: Both `pos_application` and `submitted_applications` tables updated

### 3. Bank Purchase Process

#### Updated `src/app/api/leads/[id]/purchased_applications/route.jsx`
- **Approved Leads Tracking**: Records added to `approved_leads` table
- **Offer Count**: Increments `offers_count` in `submitted_applications`
- **Revenue Tracking**: 25 SAR per purchase
- **Status Management**: Application remains in `live_auction` until 48-hour period ends

### 4. Automatic Status Transitions

#### New Auction Status Monitor (`src/lib/cron/auction-status-monitor.js`)
- **Frequency**: Runs every 5 minutes
- **Functionality**:
  - Finds expired auctions (`auction_end_time <= NOW()`)
  - Transitions based on offer count:
    - **With offers** (`offers_count > 0`): â†’ `approved_leads`
    - **No offers** (`offers_count = 0`): â†’ `ignored`
  - Updates all related tables consistently
  - Logs transitions in `status_audit_log`
  - Generates urgency alerts for expiring auctions

#### Database Functions
- **`transition_application_status()`**: Trigger function for automatic transitions
- **`check_expired_auctions()`**: Manual function to process expired auctions

### 5. Admin Interface

#### New API Endpoint: `/api/admin/banks/approved-leads`
- **Features**:
  - List all approved leads with pagination
  - Filter by bank and status
  - Summary statistics
  - Detailed lead information including bank and application details

#### New Component: `ApprovedLeadsTable.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Statistics cards showing key metrics
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Status indicators and formatting
  - Currency and date formatting
  - Responsive design

### 6. Background Processing

#### New Script: `scripts/start-auction-monitor.js`
- **Purpose**: Start the auction status monitor
- **Features**:
  - Graceful shutdown handling
  - Error handling and logging
  - Continuous monitoring

## ðŸ”„ Business Logic Flow

### Application Lifecycle
1. **Submission** â†’ `live_auction` (48-hour auction starts)
2. **Auction Period** â†’ Banks can purchase leads
3. **Auction End** â†’ Automatic transition:
   - **With offers** â†’ `approved_leads`
   - **No offers** â†’ `ignored`
4. **Completion** â†’ Admin manually marks as `complete`

### Bank Purchase Tracking
- Each bank maintains their own `approved_leads` list
- Tracks purchase date, offer details, and status
- Provides purchase history and analytics
- Enables performance monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Current System Status

### Status Distribution (After Implementation)
- **approved_leads**: 2 applications
- **complete**: 1 application  
- **ignored**: 8 applications
- **live_auction**: 0 applications (all processed)

### Approved Leads
- **Total**: 0 approved leads (new system, no purchases yet)
- **Banks**: 14 bank users in system
- **Applications**: 11 total applications

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Start Auction Monitor
```bash
node scripts/start-auction-monitor.js
```

### 2. Test the System
- Submit new applications to test `live_auction` status
- Have banks purchase leads to test `approved_leads` tracking
- Monitor automatic transitions after 48 hours

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check auction monitor logs
- Review approved leads in admin panel
- Monitor system alerts and notifications

### 4. Integration Points
- Add approved leads to admin navigation
- Integrate with existing analytics
- Set up email notifications for transitions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Database Functions Created
```sql
-- Automatic status transition trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_application_status_transition
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON approved_leads
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION transition_application_status();

-- Manual expired auction checker
SELECT check_expired_auctions();
```

### API Endpoints Updated
- `POST /api/posApplication` - Now uses `live_auction` status
- `POST /api/leads/[id]/purchased_applications` - Tracks in `approved_leads`
- `GET /api/admin/banks/approved-leads` - New endpoint for admin

### Components Added
- `ApprovedLeadsTable.jsx` - Admin interface for approved leads
- `AuctionStatusMonitor.js` - Background monitoring service

## âœ… Verification Checklist

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

The implementation successfully:
1. **Established 48-hour auction period** for all applications
2. **Created approved leads tracking** for banks
3. **Automated status transitions** based on business rules
4. **Maintained data integrity** with proper constraints
