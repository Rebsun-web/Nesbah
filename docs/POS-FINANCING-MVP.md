# POS Financing MVP Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the POS Financing MVP switch for Nesbah platform, which focuses exclusively on POS Financing services while keeping other features hidden but accessible for testing.

## Feature Flags & Configuration

### Core Configuration
The feature configuration is managed in `src/lib/config/features.js`:

```javascript
export const features = {
  // Core features
  showPosFinancing: true,
  showPosDevices: false,
  showPaymentGateway: false,
  
  // Auction configuration
  auctionWindow: {
    posFinancing: {
      defaultHours: 48,
      minRequestedAmount: 10000, // SAR
      maxRequestedAmount: 5000000, // SAR
    }
  },
  
  // Access control
  accessControl: {
    hiddenRoutes: {
      posDevices: '/pos-devices',
      paymentGateway: '/payment-gateway',
    },
    adminRoles: ['admin', 'super_admin', 'developer']
  }
}
```

### How to Toggle Features
1. **Enable/Disable POS Financing**: Set `features.showPosFinancing` to `true`/`false`
2. **Show Hidden Routes**: Set `features.showPosDevices` and `features.showPaymentGateway` to `true`
3. **Access Control**: Modify `features.accessControl.adminRoles` array to control who can access hidden features
