# Business Owner Details & BoughtLeadsDisplay Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that banks receive business owner personal details (contact person, telephone number, email) that are NOT provided by the Wathiq API, and provides a comprehensive BoughtLeadsDisplay component for the bank portal with XLSX export functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Business Owner Personal Details Separation

#### **Data Structure**
- **Wathiq API Data**: Official business registration information (CR number, sector, capital, etc.)
- **Manual Contact Details**: Personal contact information provided by business owners during application

#### **Personal Details Available to Banks**
When a bank purchases a lead, they receive:

**Business Owner Personal Details (NOT from Wathiq API):**
- `business_contact_person` - Contact person name
- `business_contact_telephone` - Contact telephone number  
- `business_contact_email` - Contact email address

**Business Information (Wathiq API):**

- All other business registration details

### 2. Updated API Endpoints

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Queries

#### **Enhanced Lead Details Query**
```sql

    bu.contact_info, bu.has_ecommerce, bu.store_url,
    
    -- Business Owner Personal Details (NOT from Wathiq API)
    pa.contact_person as business_contact_person,
    pa.contact_person_number as business_contact_telephone,
    u.email as business_contact_email,
    
    -- Application Details
    pa.notes, pa.number_of_pos_devices, pa.city_of_operation
FROM pos_application pa
JOIN business_users bu ON pa.user_id = bu.user_id
JOIN users u ON bu.user_id = u.user_id
WHERE pa.application_id = $1
```

#### **Purchased Leads Query**
```sql
SELECT 
    sa.application_id, sa.status, sa.submitted_at,
    -- Business Information (Wathiq API data)
    bu.trade_name, bu.cr_number, bu.sector, bu.cr_capital,
    bu.contact_info, bu.has_ecommerce, bu.store_url,

    -- Offer Information
    ao.offer_device_setup_fee, ao.offer_transaction_fee_mada,
    ao.offer_transaction_fee_visa_mc, ao.offer_settlement_time_mada
FROM submitted_applications sa
JOIN pos_application pa ON sa.application_id = pa.application_id
JOIN business_users bu ON pa.user_id = bu.user_id
JOIN users u ON bu.user_id = u.user_id
LEFT JOIN application_offers ao ON sa.id = ao.submitted_application_id 
    AND ao.submitted_by_user_id = $1
WHERE $1 = ANY(sa.purchased_by)
ORDER BY sa.submitted_at DESC
```
