# Nesbah Dual-Auction System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete dual-auction marketplace system for POS applications with the following key features:

- **48-hour Applications Auction**: Banks compete to purchase and offer on business applications
- **24-hour Offers Auction**: Business users select their preferred bank offer
- **Revenue Collection**: 25 SAR per lead purchase
- **Automated Status Transitions**: Cron jobs handle auction expiration and offer selection deadlines
- **Real-time Tracking**: Live countdown timers and status updates

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables
- `application_revenue`: Tracks 25 SAR payments from banks
- `offer_selections`: Records business user offer selections

### Updated Tables
- `submitted_applications`: Added auction timing and revenue tracking
- `pos_application`: Added auction timing fields
- `application_offers`: Added status tracking and selection deadlines

## Status Workflow

### Application Status Flow
```
submitted â†’ pending_offers â†’ purchased â†’ offer_received â†’ completed
         â†“                 â†“           â†“                â†“
      abandoned         abandoned   abandoned      deal_expired
```

### Offer Status Flow
```
submitted â†’ deal_won
         â†’ deal_lost
```

### Status Descriptions
- **submitted**: Application submitted and under review
- **pending_offers**: Live auction active (48-hour window for banks to purchase)
- **purchased**: Bank has purchased access to business data (25 SAR payment)
- **offer_received**: Bank has submitted an offer (24-hour window for business selection)
- **completed**: Business has selected an offer, deal finalized
- **abandoned**: No banks purchased the application during auction
- **deal_expired**: Business did not select an offer within time limit

## Key Components

### 1. Database Migration (`src/lib/db-migration.js`)
- Updates existing tables with new fields
- Migrates existing data to new status workflow
- Creates new tables for revenue and offer tracking

### 2. Status Transitions (`src/lib/cron/statusTransitions.js`)
- Automated handling of auction expiration
- Manages 24-hour offer selection windows
- Updates application and offer statuses

### 3. Offer Selection (`src/components/OfferSelection.jsx`)
- Business user interface for viewing and selecting offers
- Real-time countdown timer
- Offer comparison and selection functionality

### 4. API Endpoints

#### `/api/offers/[application_id]` (GET)
- Fetches all offers for a business user's application
- Includes offer details, bank information, and deadlines

#### `/api/offers/[application_id]` (POST)
- Business user selects preferred offer
- Updates offer statuses and application completion

## Revenue Model

- **25 SAR per lead purchase**: Collected immediately when bank purchases access
- **Multiple purchases possible**: Multiple banks can purchase the same application
- **Revenue tracking**: Stored in `application_revenue` table
- **Dashboard display**: Shows total revenue in bank portal

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### 2. Set Up Cron Jobs
Add the following cron jobs to your server:

```bash
# Run status transitions every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/project && npm run status-transitions

# Run status transitions every hour for cleanup
0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && npm run status-transitions
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure your database connection is properly configured in `src/lib/db.js`

## Usage Workflow

### For Business Users
1. Submit POS application â†’ Status: `pending_offers`
2. Wait for 48-hour auction period
3. If offers received â†’ Status: `offer_received`
4. Select preferred offer within 24 hours â†’ Status: `completed`
5. If no selection made â†’ Status: `deal_expired`

### For Bank Users
1. View available applications in "Open Applications"
2. Purchase lead access (25 SAR) â†’ Gain contact information
3. Submit competitive offer
4. Wait for business user selection
5. Receive notification of win/loss

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/posApplication` | POST | Submit new application |
| `/api/leads` | GET | Get available leads for banks |
| `/api/leads/[id]/purchased_applications` | POST | Purchase lead and submit offer |
| `/api/offers/[application_id]` | GET | Get offers for business user |
| `/api/offers/[application_id]` | POST | Select preferred offer |
| `/api/leads/stats` | GET | Get bank dashboard statistics |

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Status Monitoring
- Check application status distribution
- Monitor offer selection rates
- Track revenue collection

### Automated Cleanup
- Expired auctions automatically marked as `abandoned`
- Expired offer selections marked as `deal_expired`
- All offers updated to appropriate status

### Performance Considerations
- Indexes on `auction_end_time` and `offer_selection_end_time`
- Regular cleanup of expired records
- Monitor database performance during peak usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Migration fails**: Check database permissions and connection
2. **Status transitions not working**: Verify cron job setup
3. **Offers not showing**: Check application status and timing
4. **Revenue not tracking**: Verify `application_revenue` table exists

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check migration status
npm run migrate

# Run status transitions manually
npm run status-transitions

# Check database tables
psql -d your_database -c "\dt"
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Automated emails for status changes
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed performance metrics
3. **Payment Integration**: Automated payment processing
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Industry, amount, location filters

You're absolutely right! The application should stay in 'pending_offers' (live auction) status until the auction period ends, regardless of whether offers are submitted. Only when the auction ends should we check for offers and transition to 'offer_received' if offers exist, or 'abandoned' if no offers.

Let me fix the status transitions logic:

Now let me also update the event-driven monitoring to reflect this change:

Now let me update the Offer Management component to better reflect this workflow:

Now let me add the auction time remaining to the table display:

Now let me also add auction time information to the view modal:

Perfect! Now let me create a summary of the corrected workflow:

## ðŸŽ¯ **Corrected Live Auction Workflow**

### **1. Key Changes Made**

#### **Status Transitions Fixed**
- **Before**: Applications moved to 'offer_received' when offers were submitted
- **After**: Applications stay in 'pending_offers' until auction ends (48 hours)

#### **Auction Logic**
- **Live Auction Period**: 48 hours from application submission
- **Multiple Purchases**: Banks can purchase throughout the auction period
- **Status Change**: Only when auction ends, check for offers and transition accordingly

### **2. Corrected Workflow**

```
Application Submitted â†’ Status: pending_offers (Live Auction - 48 hours)
           â†“
    Bank A purchases â†’ purchased_by: [BankA], revenue: +25 SAR
           â†“
    Bank B purchases â†’ purchased_by: [BankA, BankB], revenue: +50 SAR
           â†“
    Bank C submits offer â†’ offers_count: 1, status: still pending_offers
           â†“
    Auction Ends (48 hours) â†’ Check for offers
           â†“
    If offers exist â†’ Status: offer_received (24-hour selection window)
    If no offers â†’ Status: abandoned
```

### **3. Updated Components**

#### **Offer Management Interface**
- **New Column**: "Auction Ends" showing time remaining
- **Status Display**: "Live Auction (2 purchased)" with time remaining
- **Auction Timer**: Real-time countdown showing hours and minutes remaining
- **Purchase Tracking**: Shows which banks purchased during auction

#### **Status Transitions**
- **Auction Expiration**: Only trigger status changes when auction ends
- **Offer Check**: Count offers when auction ends, not when submitted
- **Proper Transitions**: 
  - `pending_offers` â†’ `offer_received` (if offers exist)
  - `pending_offers` â†’ `abandoned` (if no offers)

### **4. Benefits**

âœ… **Proper Auction Timing**: Applications stay in auction for full 48 hours
âœ… **Multiple Purchases**: Banks can purchase throughout auction period
âœ… **Offer Flexibility**: Banks can submit offers anytime during auction
âœ… **Clear Deadlines**: Auction end time clearly displayed
âœ… **Revenue Maximization**: Multiple banks can purchase same application

### **5. Timeline Example**

```
Day 1, 10:00 AM: Application submitted â†’ pending_offers
Day 1, 2:00 PM: Bank A purchases â†’ +25 SAR
Day 1, 4:00 PM: Bank B purchases â†’ +25 SAR  
Day 1, 6:00 PM: Bank A submits offer â†’ offers_count: 1
Day 2, 8:00 AM: Bank C purchases â†’ +25 SAR
Day 2, 10:00 AM: Bank B submits offer â†’ offers_count: 2
Day 3, 10:00 AM: Auction ends â†’ Status: offer_received (2 offers)
Day 4, 10:00 AM: Selection period ends â†’ Status: completed/expired
```

### **6. Status Rules**

- **During Auction**: All applications stay in `pending_offers` status
- **Purchases**: Tracked in `purchased_by` array, revenue added
- **Offers**: Can be submitted anytime during auction
- **Auction End**: Only time status can change from `pending_offers`
- **After Auction**: Based on offers existence â†’ `offer_received` or `abandoned`

This corrected workflow ensures that the live auction operates properly with a fixed 48-hour window, allowing maximum participation and revenue generation! ðŸŽ‰
